# Packman
Project Scaffolding for Professionals

## Motivation
At SecureNative, we push new micro-services on a daily basis and the job of creating new projects, wiring it up, importing our common libs, etc.. is a tedious job and should be automated :)  
`packman` is a simple tool that allows you to generate boilerplate without sacrificing your freedom as a developer, no new DSL to learn, no weird config files to edit, only you and your favourite language decides the limits.

We are using `packman` intensively at SecureNative 

## Prerequisites
- Go 1.11 or above with [Go Modules enabled](https://github.com/golang/go/wiki/Modules#how-to-use-modules)
- Basic knowledge of [Go's templating engine](https://curtisvermeeren.github.io/2017/09/14/Golang-Templates-Cheatsheet)
- Git account (Github, Bitbucket, GitLab, etc...)

## How to get it
If you have golang installed just use:  
`go get -u github.com/securenative/packman`

You can also use one of the pre-built binaries from our [releases page](https://github.com/securenative/packman/releases)

after that you can use `packman` to get templates, try it now:  
```bash
packman unpack \
    https://github.com/securenative/packman-init \
    packmanExample \
    -author matan \
    -company SecureNative
```

## API Reference

### Render
While working on your *template project* you'll need to constantly render your template to check if it works.  
The `packman render` command will take a local path to the template's folder and a list of custom flags and 
in return will create a new folder with the rendered template.
```bash
packman render <TEMPLATE_PATH> \
    -key-1 value-1 \ 
    -key-2 value-2 \
    ... \
    -key-n value-n
```

For example if I have a template called `myProject` and it requires the following flags: `host`, `port` running:  
```bash
packman render myProject \
    -host 127.0.0.1 \ 
    -port 9909
```
will create a new folder called `myProject-rendered` with the rendered template.

### Unpack
Unpack is the **"wet"** version of render, the only difference is that unpack will ask you where to get the template from (i.e which git repository to clone).  
```bash
packman unpack <REMOTE_PATH> <LOCAL_PATH> \
    -key-1 value-1 \ 
    -key-2 value-2 \
    ... \
    -key-n value-n
```

### Pack
Pack will just commit and push your changes to the remote git repository, if you prefer (and basically you should) you can manage it manually with your favourite git client.  
```bash
packman pack <LOCAL_PATH> <REMOTE_PATH>
```

### Auth
To get access to private repositories or to use the `packman pack` command you'll need to authenticate with git.   
```bash
packman auth <USERNAME> <PASSWORD>
```

### Change the default script engine
While the default script engine uses GO and as much as we love GO at SecureNative, `packman` was built as an un-opinionated tool so we don't impose any limit on your scripting capabilities.  
You can use any language to write scripts, damn, you can even use bash scripts to generate your template as long as you respect the interface with `packman`.  
`packman` scripts defines 2 standards that you must comply to:
1) The script will be executed with 2 additional command-line arguments, the path to the flags.json file and the path to save the reply.json file.
2) The script has to write its reply (as json) to the reply path (provided as a cli argument)  

You can see its pretty simple requirements to fulfil, you can check [this code](https://github.com/securenative/packman/blob/master/pkg/packman.go) to better understand it.   

```bash
packman script "go run" # Will run go files
packman script "python" # will run python files
packman script "node"   # will run javascript files
```
